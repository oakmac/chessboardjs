[ChessBoardJS](http://chessboardjs.com) - JavaScript Chess Board
==================================================

What is ChessBoardJS?
--------------------------------------

ChessBoardJS is a standalone JavaScript Chess Board. It is designed to be "just a board" and expose a powerful API so that it can be used in different ways. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things you can do with ChessBoardJS:

- Use ChessBoardJS to show game positions alongside your expert commentary.
- Use ChessBoardJS to have a tactics website where users have to guess the best move.
- Integrate ChessBoard and [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) with a PGN database and allow people to search and playback games.
- Build a chess server and have users play their games out using the ChessBoardJS board.

ChessBoardJS is flexible enough to handle any of these situations with relative ease.

What is ChessBoardJS not?
--------------------------------------

Here is a list of things that ChessBoard is **not**:

- A chess engine
- A legal move validator
- A PGN parser

ChessBoardJS is designed to work well with any of those things, but the idea behind ChessBoardJS is that the logic that controls the board should be indepenent of those other problems.
